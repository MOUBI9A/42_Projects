# Get_Next_Line

## Description
Get_Next_Line is a function that reads a file descriptor line by line. It allows you to read a line from a file descriptor, such as a text file, and store it in a string.
## Features
- Reads a file descriptor line by line
- Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously
- Supports reading from standard input (stdin)

## Usage
To use the Get_Next_Line function, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MOUBI9A/Get_Next_Line.git
    ```

2. Include the `get_next_line.h` header file in your project:
    ```c
    #include "get_next_line.h"
    ```

3. Call the `get_next_line` function to read a line from a file descriptor:
    ```c
    int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
    ```

    The function returns 1 if a line has been read, 0 if the end of file has been reached, or -1 in case of an error.

4. Remember to free the memory allocated for the line when you're done with it:
    ```c
    free(line);
    ```
